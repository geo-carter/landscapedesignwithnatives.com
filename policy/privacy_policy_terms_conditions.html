    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2> 
    <p><br /></p>
    <p>Introduction</p>
        <p></p>We believe that privacy is a right. We want to empower our clients to be the masters of their identity. In this privacy policy, we want to help you understand how and why  Dancing Sophia Publishing collects and uses information about you when you fill out our Design request form and answer questions in writing or verbally or when you otherwise interact with us or receive a communication from us.</p>
        
        <p>We collect minimal information about you.</p>
        <p>We collect minimal information that can be used to identify you and your area to be designed. I will satellite map software to view your address and draw your plot to be designed. I will ask for pictures that will be used only for design purposes.</p>
        
        <p>We only use the data you provide to do the design you request</p> 
        <p>Any data we collect is used to provide our Design Service, which are focused on designing the landscape that will suit your needs and wishes </p>
        
        <p>All of our clients get privacy rights.</p>
        <p>Privacy rights are for everyone. Once the work is completed, the data will be saved for 2 years or longer if you continue to work with us. This is so weird can make changes to your design if your needs change.</p>
        
        <p>If you have questions about how we use data, just ask.</p>
        <p>We've tried our best to make this as easy to understand as possible but sometimes privacy policies are still confusing. If you need help understanding this policy or anything about our landscape design service, just ask.</p>
        
        <p><br /></p>
        <h2>Terms and Conditions</h2> 
        <p>We simply ask that you provide the information we need for drawing your design complete with natives selected for your area. If you agree to the quote provided, your submission of the downpayment requested is considered your consent to begin work. Once the work is done and you approve the work completed in writing, you will send balance owed and then we shall send you the book complete with design and plant lists. IF for any reason we fail to complete the work your downpayment will be refunded.</p>    
        <p>We don't sell books from our site. Please see Lulu and Amazon for their return policies on book purchases.</p>
